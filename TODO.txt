::MAJOR QUESTIONS::
-need some sort of zipper or map into nodes
  -e.g. `Event t (REltNode t, REltZipper)`
-manipulators
-actions
  -SBoxManipulator will create events of the following type:
    Event t (Action )
  -ActionStack :: []

  -onUndo :: Event t ()
  -

::DESIGN::



::mouse states::
-active
  -in active state, an action is staged and continuously do/undo a it's being updated
  -once leaving active state, action is moved onto stack and executed

::manipulator::

::elements + layers::
-empty elt (like unity)
  -empty elt approach disadvantage is folders do not care about position and have no manipulators etc

::main events::
eltList :: Dynamic Elt -- top level elements

::elt events::
-listening
  destroyed :: Event () <- is this even needed?

::trigger events::
save :: () -> IO ()
load :: Text -> IO ()
