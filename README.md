# tinytools
`tinytools` is a mono-space unicode flow-chart editor written in Haskell.

# architecture
`tinytools` follows a strict MVC architecture. This repository contains the platform-independent model and controller.
The view/controller is connected to the model using a [reflex](https://github.com/reflex-frp/reflex) interface defined by `GoatWidget`.

[tinytools-vty](https://github.com/pdlla/tinytools-vty) is currently the only view implementation. It is written in [reflex-vty](https://github.com/reflex-frp/reflex-vty) and runs in a terminal yay. Please see [tinytools-vty](https://github.com/pdlla/tinytools-vty) if you'd like to try it out.

# features (completed)
- sophisticated hierarchical layer system

- scriptable command interface


# Contribution Guide

Help wanted! I will of course review any PR. For large or small ideas, it would be best to drop me an email first at chippermonky at gmail dot com

Below are a list of tasks that I think would be extra good projects to work on

- CI scripts for creating binary releases
- add text selection support to current `TextZipper` implementation and fix bugs
- refactoring ðŸ˜‘
