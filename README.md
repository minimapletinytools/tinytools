# potato-illustrator
`potato-illustrator` is a mono-space text flow-chart editor written in Haskell. It is currently a work in progress and an ALPHA release should be available soon.

# architecture
`potato-illustrator` is written using [reflex](https://github.com/reflex-frp/reflex) and follows a strict MVC architecture. This repository contains the platform-independent model and controller.
The View is connected to the reflex interface defined by `GoatWidget`.

[potato-illustrator-vty](https://github.com/pdlla/potato-illustrator-vty) is currently the only view implementation. It is written in [reflex-vty](https://github.com/reflex-frp/reflex-vty) and runs in a terminal yay. Please see [potato-illustrator-vty](https://github.com/pdlla/potato-illustrator-vty) if you'd like to try it out.

# Contribution Guide

Help wanted! I will of course review any PR. For large or small ideas, it would be best to drop me an email first at chippermonky at gmail dot com

Below are a list of tasks that I think would be extra good projects to work on

- CI scripts for creating binary releases
- UNICODE wide character support
- add text selection support to current `TextZipper` implementation
- refactoring ðŸ˜‘
