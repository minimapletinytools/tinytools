{- $general

Categorically, the 'Wedge' datatype represents the coproduct (like, 'Either')
in the category Hask* of pointed Hask types, called a <https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/wedge+sum wedge sum>.
The category Hask* consists of Hask types affixed with
a dedicated base point along with an object. In Hask, this is
equivalent to `1 + a`, also known as 'Maybe a'. Because we can conflate
basepoints of different types (there is only one @Nothing@ type), the wedge sum is
can be viewed as the type `1 + a + b`, or `Maybe (Either a b)` in Hask.
Pictorially, one can visualize this as:


@
'Wedge':
                a
                |
Nowhere +-------+
                |
                b
@


The fact that we can think about 'Wedge' as a coproduct gives us
some reasoning power about how a 'Wedge' will interact with the
product in Hask*, called 'Can'. Namely, we know that a product of a type and a
coproduct, `a * (b + c)`, is equivalent to `(a + b) * (a + c)`. Additioally,
we may derive other facts about its associativity, distributivity, commutativity, and
any more. As an exercise, think of soemthing `Either` can do. Now do it with 'Wedge'!
